Warehouse Space Utilization Analysis
Analyzing Warehouse Space, Profitability, and Costs

Introduction

 The Warehouse Space Utilization Analysis Dashboard is designed to 
provide comprehensive insights into the utilization of warehouse space, 
profitability, and costs associated with product storage. This analysis 
focuses on key metrics like warehouse space usage, profit generated across 
various product categories, and revenue over time. The primary goal is to 
help warehouse managers and business stakeholders optimize space 
utilization, reduce costs, and focus on profitable product categories.

 Through this dashboard, decision-makers can:
 
 • Understand how different sections of the warehouse are being utilized.
 
 • Identify high-profit categories.
 
 • Track revenue and cost trends over time.
 
 • Make informed decisions on inventory management and space
 optimization

 The Utilization Rate by Section chart 
provides insights into the percentage 
of warehouse space occupied by 
different sections:

 ➢Refrigerated goods occupy the 
largest portion (35.35%).

 ➢Dry goods and Perishables follow 
closely, each utilizing significant 
portions of the warehouse.

 Actionable Insight: Optimizing 
space in Refrigerated and Dry Goods 
sections can increase efficiency. 
Monitoring the Perishables section 
for any unused space is crucial to 
avoid spoilage and maximize space 
usage

The Utilization Rate by Category 
chart shows that product categories 
such as Electronics, Groceries, and 
Clothing are among the highest in 
terms of space usage.

 Actionable Insight: 
 
 Focus on the 
efficient management of these high
usage categories to ensure optimal 
space utilization and reduce 
overstocking or space wastage in 
lower-priority categories
